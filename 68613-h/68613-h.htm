<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the Clergy of the Diocese of Lincoln are
responsible for the issue of this booklet. A much-needed
county history of Lincolnshire is now being
projected, upon the basis of separate parochial
histories. A circular put forth in one of the rural
deaneries was good enough to refer in laudatory
terms to the introduction to the first volume of my
<i>Notes on the Churches of Derbyshire</i>. This led to my
being asked to re-publish that introduction; but it
applied so peculiarly to Derbyshire that I felt it
would be of small avail to those outside the county.
Hence I decided to put together some hints that
might prove a help to those who may be desirous of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
undertaking parochial history in any part of the
kingdom, whether manorial, ecclesiastical, or both.
In the first part of these pages I am indebted to
Thomas’s “Handbook to the Public Records,” and
more especially to Sims’s invaluable “Manual for
the Topographer and Genealogist;” but I have not
referred to any class of documents with which I am
not in some measure personally conversant.</p>

<p>Those who have been engaged in any literary
work are well aware how large a portion of time
is often spent in merely learning the titles and
somewhat of the contents of those books that treat
of the different branches of the subject selected.
Various books connected with parochial history,
especially those that have been proved by experience
to be the best hand-books, are therefore mentioned
in these pages to facilitate reference. Space only
has prevented me from considerably adding both
to their number and description, but any further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
knowledge that I may have gleaned on topographical
literature is heartily at the disposal of any <i>worker</i>
who may privately apply to me.</p>

<p>I shall be grateful for any correction of errors,
or for any suggestion as to deficiencies.</p>

<p class="ph2">HOW TO WRITE THE HISTORY<br />

OF A PARISH.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Etymology.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> only should the etymology of the name of the
parish be carefully considered, and its various forms
of spelling be collected, from Domesday Book downwards,
but a list should be made of the whole of the
names of the physical features, such as hills, streams,
and lanes, and especially of the field-names. Field-names—which
will often establish the sites of disused
chapels or manor-houses, of Celtic burials or Roman
roads, as well as help to decide the nationality of the
colonists that predominated in the district—can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
sometimes gleaned from old private estate maps, or
other exceptional sources, but the “Award” maps
of Inclosure Commissioners from 1710 downwards,
or the Tithe Commutation maps of 1836, are the
chief and most reliable sources. These maps should
be in most parish chests, but they have often
illegally strayed into the private hands of solicitors,
churchwardens, etc. When lost or difficult of access,
the original maps can usually be seen at the offices
of the Copyhold Inclosure and Tithe Commission,
3, St. James’s Square, on payment of 2s. 6d.; but
under certain Acts the originals will be found, or
rather ought to be found and to be accessible, at the
Clerk of the Peace’s office for the county.</p>

<p>The best hand-books on local etymology are—Taylor’s
“Words and Places,” and Edmund’s
“Names of Places.” Leo on “The Local Nomenclature
of the Anglo-Saxons,” Charnock’s “Local
Etymology and Derivative Dictionary,” and Ferguson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
“River Names,” and “Teutonic Name System”
may also be consulted with advantage.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">“Prehistoric” Remains.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If there are any so-called “Druidical” (almost
invariably a complete misnomer) or other “prehistoric”
remains of that class, not a word should be
written respecting them until Fergusson’s “Rude
Stone Monuments” has been thoroughly digested.
Though published in 1872, not one of the old-fashioned
antiquaries has made any serious attempt
to refute its conclusions.</p>

<p>The best work on tumuli, or barrows, is Canon
Greenwell’s “British Barrows.” See also Bateman’s
“Ten Years’ Diggings in Celtic and Saxon Grave
Hills.” The two last essays of Sir John Lubbock’s
“Scientific Lectures” give a popular account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
that branch of prehistoric archæology which deals
with the palæolithic and neolithic periods, <i>i.e.</i>, with
the races who respectively used the chipped and
ground weapons of stone.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">History of the Manor.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, and other Old English
chronicles, should be consulted for possible early
mention of the parish. Most of these have been
cheaply printed in an English dress in Bohn’s Antiquarian
Series. In Kemble’s “Saxons in England”
will be found a good list of the old tribal divisions
into “marks.” Thorpe’s <i>Diplomatarium Anglicum Ævi
Saxonici</i> is an admirable collection of early charters
(with translations); some of the wills contain many
place-names; the volume is indifferently indexed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Domesday Book</span>, compiled in 1085-6, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
preserved at the Chapter House, Westminster. It
gives particulars of all the different manors throughout
England, excepting those of Northumberland,
Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham. It was
printed in two large volumes in 1783, and a third
volume of indexes and introductory matter added in
1811. A most valuable “General Introduction” was
published in 1833, by Sir Henry Ellis. The Ordnance
Survey have recently brought out a fac-simile
edition of the Domesday Book, produced by Photo-zincography,
which can be obtained in separate
counties. The extended text and translation of most
counties can also be procured.</p>

<p>The Book of Exeter and the Book of Ely are of
the same date, and no doubt copied from the same
returns as Domesday Book itself, but they contain
many more details. The former, preserved at Exeter
Cathedral, comprises the counties of Wilts, Dorset,
Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall; the latter, now in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the British Museum, relates to Cambridge, Hertford,
Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Huntingdon. The Book
of Winchester (Society of Antiquaries) relates to
that borough; it was made in 1148. The Boldon
Book is a survey of the county palatinate of Durham,
taken in 1183; there are three copies, two at Durham,
and one at the Bodleian. These four minor
Surveys were published by the Record Commissioners
in one volume in 1816.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knight’s Fees.</span> When England was subdivided
by the Conqueror among his vassals, the feudal
custom of supplying the crown with a certain number
of knights was imposed upon them. The
number of knights that had to be furnished was
specified in the infeoffment. These knights, in their
turn, held lands from the immediate tenants of the
crown, which were owned by homage, fealty, and a
great variety of tenures, as well as by direct payments
in money. Some tenures were merely nominal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
such as a grain of cummin, or a red rose; others
were of more or less value, such as a pair of white
gloves, a tun of wine, a gold spur, or a silver salver;
and others by such service as holding the lord’s
stirrup, keeping a pack of hounds, etc., etc. See
Blount’s “Ancient Tenures.” The lands of these
knights were termed “Fees,” and composed the
barony of a crown vassal. A knight’s fee was supposed
to be so much land as would suffice to maintain
him, and to enable him to present himself and his
retainers ready equipped for the field in times of
emergency. Hence a “Knight’s Fee,” as applied to
land, represents no definite quantity, but a variable
amount, generally between one and five hundred
acres of cultivable land. The term is also sometimes
used for the rent paid to the lord for the fee.</p>

<p>It is easy, then, to see that it became essential to
the Crown, both for monetary and judicial purposes,
as well national as local, to know from time to time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the exact position of their vassals and sub-vassals.
Hence, Inquisitions were held up and down the
country before local sworn juries, and the barons
made returns of that which they held, and which
was held under them. These returns are among the
earliest of our national records; and though brief,
are invaluable, from their absolute authenticity, to
the genealogist and local historian. The chief documents
of this class are the <i>Black Book of the
Exchequer, temp.</i> Henry II., the original of which is
in the P. R. O., but three manuscript copies are in
the B. M., C., and B. respectively, and it was
published (but imperfectly, and not from the original)
by Hearn, in two vols., 8vo., last century; the
<i>Scutage</i> and the <i>Marshall Rolls, temp.</i>, Edw. I. &amp; II.,
P. R. O.; various lists of Tenants in Capite in our
different public libraries; and, most important, the
<i>Testa de Neville</i>. The last-mentioned of these documents
consists of two ancient volumes compiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
<i>temp.</i> Edw. II., now in the P. R. O. They consist
of Inquisitions, taken <i>temp.</i> Henry III. and Edw. I.,
respecting the Fees held immediately or otherwise
of the King, throughout the whole of England,
excepting the counties of Cambridge, Cheshire,
Durham, Lancashire, and Monmouthshire. These
records were officially printed in one vol., folio, in
1807; there are many errors in the spelling of place-names,
but these can for the most part be readily
detected by any one having local knowledge. Another
folio volume, printed in 1802, is the <i>Nonarum
Inquisitiones</i>; it is of some value, and may, perhaps,
be fairly included under the head of “Knight’s Fees.”
It consists, in the main, of the finding upon oath
by the parishioners, of the value of the ninth lamb,
fleece, and sheep, and in cities and boroughs of the
ninth of goods and chattels, which by an Act
14 Edw. III. were to be levied as a tax for two years
towards the expenditure in the Scotch and French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
wars. The rolls abound in the names of jurymen,
commissioners, and landowners. The published
volume only contains the returns from twenty-seven
counties, but the Nona Rolls for most of the missing
ones, <i>e.g.</i>, Derby, Hertford, Northumberland, and
Warwick, have since been found. MS. indexes of
these will be found in the small books lettered
“Exchequer Subsidies” in the search room of the
P. R. O.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rotuli.</span> Under the general head of “Rolls,” some
of the most important of our national documents
have to be briefly considered.</p>

<p>The Great Rolls of the Exchequer, otherwise called
the <i>Pipe Rolls</i>, are all but perfect from 2 Henry II.
to the present time; and there is one roll of
31 Henry I., the oldest national document now
extant after the Domesday Book. They relate to
the revenues of the Crown, digested under the heads
of the several counties. They are of much interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and utility in early pedigrees, and relate to a far
wider range of subjects than Crown lands, as the
Crown revenues come from so great a diversity of
sources. The originals are in the P. R. O., but most
of the rolls are in duplicate at the B. M. Several
volumes of transcripts are in the B. M. and B. The
Rolls for the 31 Henry I.; 3 John; 2, 3, and 4,
Henry II.; and 1 Richard I., have been published
by the Record Commissioners.</p>

<p>The <i>Patent Rolls</i> commence with 3 John, and are
fairly perfect up to the present time. On them are
entered all grants of lands, offices, honours, pensions,
and particulars of individual or corporate privileges,
etc., etc. These invaluable Rolls are unfortunately
not indexed. A folio calendar of those from John to
23 Edward IV., was printed in 1802, but it is only
a capriciously made selection. Those from the 3rd
to 18th John have since been printed in full, with an
admirable introduction. In the B. M. are many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
volumes of selections and extracts for particular
periods. Manorial grants of “free warren” in these
rolls will often supply a missing link in the
history of a manor.</p>

<p>The difference between the documents entered on
the <i>Close Rolls</i>, and the Patent Rolls, is that royal
letters patent were delivered <i>open</i>, with the Great
Seal appended, and were supposed to be of a public
nature and addressed to all the king’s subjects;
whilst the Close Rolls contain entries of such instruments
as were despatched <i>closed</i> or sealed up, and
were of a more private nature. These rolls begin in
1204. From that time to 11 Henry III., they have
been printed in full in two folio volumes. There are
various copies and transcripts of particular parts in
the B.M., B., and C., and in the libraries of Lincoln’s
Inn and Inner Temple. The rolls are of infinite variety
and importance. Among the subjects treated of are—Royal
Prerogatives, Homage, Fealty, Knight’s Service,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Treasure Trove, Gold and Silver Mining, Bail
and Pardons, Livery of Lands, Assignment of
Dowers, Wardship of Minors, Repairs of Bridges,
etc., etc. They often, therefore, contain unexpected
fragments of local history connected with apparently
insignificant parishes, and are even more fruitful
than the better known Patent Rolls.</p>

<p>The <i>Charter Rolls</i> contain a good deal of duplicate
matter to that on the Patent Rolls. They chiefly
consist of grants of privileges to religious houses,
cities, and towns, and grants of markets, fairs, and
free warren to individuals. Charters, like Letters
Patent, passed under the Great Seal; but a charter
differed from a patent inasmuch as the former was
witnessed by the council or by such persons as were
present at its execution, and the latter was solely
executed by the king. The Charter Rolls extend
from 1199 to 1483. A complete calendar of these
rolls, well indexed, was published in 1803, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
rolls themselves of the reign of John, were also
published by the Record Commissioners in 1837.</p>

<p>The <i>Fine Rolls</i> contain accounts of fines paid to
the Crown for licenses to alienate lands, for freedom
from knight service, or being knighted, for renewals
of various charters, etc., etc. They begin in the
time of Richard I. The Fine Rolls of John, and
extracts from those of Henry III., have been published
by the Commissioners in three 8vo. volumes.
They are to be distinguished from the important
<i>Pedes Finium</i>, subsequently explained.</p>

<p>The <i>Originalia</i> are described in the Public Records
Report as “the Estreats transmitted from the Court
of Chancery into this (Exchequer) office, of all grants
of the Crown inrolled on the Patent and other Rolls,
whereon any rent is reserved, any salary payable, or
any service performed.” These rolls commence early
in the reign of Henry III. An abstract, in two
folio volumes, of the Originalia from 20 Henry III.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
to the end of Edward III., was published by the
Commissioners in 1805. Similar abstracts from
1 Richard II., to end of James II., were prepared
for printing, but never published; the MS. of this
work is in the B. M. An index to the Originalia was
published in 1793, by Mr. Edward Jones, in two
folio volumes. Those who have had occasion to use
Mr. Jones’s index know that the judgment “very
useful, but very imperfect,” is true in each particular.</p>

<p>The <i>Hundred Rolls</i> will often prove to be of the
greatest interest for one period of manorial history.
During the turbulent reign of Henry III., the Crown
revenues had been much diminished by the Tenants
in Capite alienating lands without license, and by
powerful ecclesiastics and laymen usurping the rights
of holding courts, and committing other encroachments.
The people, too, had been greatly oppressed
by exactions and oppressions at the hands of sheriffs
and other officers, and by false claims to free warren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and illegal tolls. One of the first acts of Edward I.,
on his return from the Holy Land, at his father’s
death, was to remedy these abuses. The circuit of
the itinerant justices was only usually made once in
seven years, therefore the king appointed Special
Commissioners for inquiring into these grievances
throughout the realm. These rolls are the result of
the inquisitions taken in pursuance of this commission.
They afford evidence, upon the oath of a jury
of each hundred and town of—all demesne lands and
manors then or formerly in the hands of the Crown—all
tenants in capite and tenants in ancient demesne—alienations
to the Church—rights of free warren,
fisheries, etc.—oppressions of nobility and clergy—exactions
of excessive toll—unlawful trading—encroachments
on highways, etc., etc. The whole of
these rolls were published by the Record Commissioners
in 1812-18, in two large folio volumes, but
are not now to be purchased. “The genealogist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
may estimate the assistance these volumes are
capable of affording, when it is mentioned that the
Indices of Names contain references to about 70,000
persons.” The mis-spelling of place-names is sometimes
a little misleading, but ordinary care will rectify
this, as the returns are arranged in counties. The
rolls, as printed, may be fairly relied on for historical
purposes, without the trouble of collating the
originals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Placita.</span> The pleadings of our several courts,
with the judgments thereon, have been for many
centuries entered on rolls. The greater part of these
are termed Placita, or pleading Rolls. Their important
bearing on manorial history is obvious. There
is scarcely a manor in the kingdom that had not
occasion, on an average of at least once a century,
to put in an appearance in one or other of the courts
on some matter involving litigation.</p>

<p>Under our Norman kings, all pleadings were originally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
heard <i>Aula sive Curia Regis</i>, in the hall or
court of the king’s palace. In aid of the King’s
Court, itinerant justices were first appointed <i>temp.</i>
Henry I., and were finally established 22 Henry II.
Towards the end of the reign of Richard I., the Curia
Regis was subdivided into courts of Exchequer and
Chancery, whilst the king’s court still retained pleas
immediately touching the Crown, and also common
pleas, both civil and criminal. The Magna Charta,
17 John, separated the Common Pleas from the
royal court, after which the Curia Regis continued
to be the superior court of law for criminal matters,
and early in the reign of Edward I. lost its more
ancient title and became known as the Court of
King’s Bench.</p>

<p>The <i>Rotuli Curia Regis</i> have been printed in full,
from 6 Richard I. to 1 John, by the Record Commissioners,
in two 8vo. volumes. The same rolls, in
addition to those of the King’s Bench, down to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
end of the reign of Edward II., were, in 1811,
elaborately calendared and indexed by the Commissioners
in a valuable folio volume, under the title—<i>Placitorum
in Domo Capitulari Westmonasteriensi
asservatorum Abbreviatio</i>, but the rolls are now in the
P. R. O. The abstract has been made after a fickle
fashion, some pleadings are given in full, whilst
many others of more importance are condensed into
a couple of lines; and there is nothing in the volume
to tell the student whether they are abbreviated or
not.</p>

<p>The earliest provincial courts were those of the
Itinerant Justices, or Justices in Eyre (from the
Norman-French word <i>erre</i>, a journey); they held
criminal and common pleas, and also pleas of the
forest. These justices afterwards gave way to Circuit
Judges, and the Justices in Eyre then became only
another name for the <i>Justices of the Forest</i>. If there
is or has been any royal Forest or Chace within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
parish under consideration, special search should be
made for its records. Most of the early proceedings
relative to forests are entered on the Patent Rolls;
a considerable number of the ancient perambulations
and inquisitions have been printed in various reports
made at different dates. Copies of these reports,
bound in two large volumes, can be consulted at the
P. R. O. Extracts from the rolls, relative to the
forests, for special periods may be found both at the
P. R. O. and the B. M. The forest perambulations for
the reigns of Henry III. and Edward I. have been
completely indexed.</p>

<p>Those rolls that may properly be termed <i>Records
of Assize</i> commence 6 Richard I., and end with the
reign of Edward IV. In the B. M. are many MS.
volumes of <i>Placita Itinerum</i> pertaining to different
reigns and different counties.</p>

<p>In 1818 the Record Commissioners published an
important folio volume, entitled <i>Placita de Quo Warranto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
temporibus Edw. I., II., III.</i>, which forms an
interesting sequel to the Hundred Rolls. The Hundred
Rolls, as already mentioned, gave a great mass
of sworn information as to abuses. Those persons
thus charged were summoned to answer “<i>Quo
Warranto</i>” such and such things were done or left
undone? or by what right such and such manors,
etc., were held? This volume contains a full transcript
of the roll of the pleadings in answer to these
summonses, and the judgments thereon. Its utility
in manorial history cannot be exaggerated, as the
descent of the manor is often traced back in these
pleadings to the time of John or even earlier. The
rolls are arranged under counties, and include the
whole of England, with the exception of the palatinate
of Durham.</p>

<p>The earliest records of the <i>Court of Chancery</i> are
of the 17th year of Richard II., the previous documents
having been destroyed in the Wat Tyler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
rebellion. There are no petitions extant to the
Chancellor of the reign of Henry IV., and but few
of Henry V., but from the beginning of the reign of
Henry VI. they seem to have been kept with much
regularity. Calendars of the Chancery proceedings
of the reign of Elizabeth were published in three
volumes folio, 1827-32. In the introduction to this
work are many examples of the earlier proceedings
of that court from Richard II. downwards. It is
hardly necessary to add that the bills of complaint,
and their answers, filed in this court, often contain
abundant information as to manorial descent.
Numerous MS. volumes of indexes to Chancery
proceedings are at the service of the searcher in the
P. R. O.</p>

<p>The volumes known as the <i>Year Books</i> contain
reports in Norman-French of cases argued and
decided in the Courts of Common Law. They form
the basis of the “<i>lex non scripta</i>” of English jurisprudence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and are worthy of attention on account of
the historical information and the notices of public
and private persons which they contain. The frequent
disputes about heirship cause them often to be
of value in manorial history. These Reports begin
in 1220, and an account of the different books, their
dates, etc., may be found in Worrall’s “<i>Bibliotheca
Legum Angliæ</i>,” 1788. Serjeant Maynard published
an edition of early Year Books, in eleven volumes,
in 1679. Several of those of the reign of Edward I.
have been edited by the Record Commissioners.
Lincoln’s Inn Library, and the University Library,
Cambridge, have a great number of MS. Year Books.
A work of much research, by Mr. Bigelow, has just
been published, entitled “<i>Placita Anglo-Normannica</i>,”
it is a history of the litigation and legal procedure
of the temporal courts during the period from the
Norman Conquest to the middle of the reign of
Richard I. If there has been any early dispute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
about the manor or manorial rights, this volume
should certainly be consulted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inquisitiones.</span> <i>Inquisitiones post mortem</i>, are not
unfrequently termed “Escheats,” from the writs
being directed to the county official called the
Escheator; but the term is incorrect, and should
never be used, for there is a class of documents
correctly called <i>Escheat Rolls</i>, which differ altogether
from these inquisitions, and refer to the escheator’s
accounts of lands and property escheated to the
crown from various causes, and the profits and
value of the same at different periods. The <i>Inquisitio
post mortem</i>, on the contrary, was an inquiry
held on oath by a jury of the district, summoned
by virtue of a writ directed to the county Escheator,
on the death of every tenant in capite. The jury
had to inquire (1) of what lands the person died
seized, (2) by what rents or services the same were
held, and (3) who was his next heir and of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
age; they had also to ascertain whether the tenant
was attainted of treason, or an alien, in which case
the lands reverted to the crown. The return of the
jury, together with the writ authorising the inquiry,
were returned to the King’s Chancery, whence a
transcript was sent to the Exchequer, so that the
proper officers might be able to levy the duties and
services thereupon due; for on the death of each
tenant in capite, a tax termed a “relief” was due to
the crown, and the heir could not take possession
until the relief was paid and homage done. Moreover,
if the heir was a minor, the crown administered
the estates until he could make proof of his
legal age and perform homage. The Exchequer
transcripts of these Inquisitions, together in most
cases with the writ, are still extant from the time
of Henry III. down to the end of the reign of
Charles I., that is, until the feudal land system was
finally overthrown. Calendars, or short abstracts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
these Inquisitions, carefully indexed, have been
printed in four folio volumes by the Record Commissioners,
1806-1828, up to the end of the reign
of Richard III. These calendars, which are invaluable
for reference, must be used with caution, and
should never be quoted as proving the death of any
person by a particular date, for unfortunately not a
few inquisitions that are not <i>post mortem</i>, but <i>ad
quod damnum</i>, are included amongst them. There
are also many errors in nomenclature, and in assigning
manors to special counties; it is therefore wisest
to make the rule of never quoting these inquisitions,
unless the original has been seen, or a full transcript
obtained. The inquisitions subsequent to the
time of Richard III. have not been calendared. Private
enterprise has more than once announced that
such a work would be taken in hand, and subscribers
names obtained, but up to the present time (1879)
there seems no immediate prospect of publication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>The Record Commissioners have also published
a Calendar to the Inquisitions of this class, pertaining
to the Duchy of Lancaster, from the time of
Edward I. to Charles I.</p>

<p>Extracts and abstracts from these Inquisitions,
covering particular periods, or for particular counties,
are numerous in our public libraries; for lists
of such MSS., see Sims’ <i>Manual</i>, pp. 125-8.</p>

<p>Another form of inquisition was the <i>Inquisitio
ad quod damnum</i>, which was a judicial inquiry, held
by virtue of a writ directed to the Escheator of the
county, when any license of alienation of lands, or
grant of a market, fair, or other privilege was
solicited. A local jury was sworn to inquire whether
if the claim was granted it would interfere with any
vested right, or be to the detriment of the crown or
some of its subjects—hence the name <i>ad quod damnum</i>.
These inquisitions, especially with relation to
alienating lands to religious houses, are often very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
valuable to the local historian, for the jury in such
cases had to state the amount, value, and nature of
the remainder of the lands of the intended donor.
A calendar of these records from 1 Edward II. to
38 Henry VI., was officially published in 1803, and
is bound up with the previously mentioned calendar
of the Charter Rolls. It should be remembered,
as already stated, that many inquisitions <i>ad quod
damnum</i>, particularly the earlier ones, are wrongly
catalogued and arranged among the <i>post mortem</i>
inquests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pedes Finium.</span> The <i>Pedes Finium</i>, or “Feet of
Fines,” must be clearly distinguished from the previously
mentioned Fine Rolls, which are quite a
different class of record. The Fine here signified is
no mulct of money, but is so called because it
is the <i>final</i> agreement between persons concerning
any lands or rents or other matters whereof there
is any suit between them. The fine, or solemn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
contract recorded before a competent judge, is
described as having five parts—(1) the original writ
taken out against the cognisor, (2) the license of
the crown giving the parties liberty to accord, (3)
the concord itself, (4) the note of the fine, which is
an abstract of the original concord, and (5) the <i>foot
of the fine</i>, which always began thus—“Hæc est <i>finalis</i>
concordia facta in curia Dom. Regis apud Westm”
etc. This foot of the fine, which was the official
summary of the concord, was cut off in an indented
line (hence the word <i>indenture</i>), so as to tally with
the part delivered to the suitor and prove its authenticity,
and retained by the court. There is no class
of documents that has been so continuously preserved
in uninterrupted succession as these Feet of Fines.
No manorial history can be considered satisfactory
until these records have been carefully consulted,
for they contain the proceedings which have been
adopted to convey estates, as well as to free them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
from their entailment to issue, or from the dower of
wives. The earliest of these documents, viz., from
7 Richard I. to 16 John, have been officially published
in two 8vo. volumes, under the title—“<i>Fines,
sive Pedes Finium; sive Finales Concordiæ, in Curia
Domini Regis</i>.”</p>

<p>Having thus run through the chief classes of
documents bearing, with more or less directness,
on manorial history, it may be added that further
information should be sought in Mr. Thomas’
“Handbook to the Public Records.” It may also
be well to mention, that those who require accurate
transcripts of any of the records in Fetter Lane,
need not apply for officially certified copies; for
reliable transcribers can readily be met with who
will do the work for less than half the sum required
for certified copies. If the amateur searcher does
not know any transcribers, the courteous gentlemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
in charge of the Search Room will probably make
no difficulty about giving their address.</p>

<p>Those who may be desirous of gaining some knowledge
of the character or handwriting of ancient
records, which can only be efficiently learnt by practice,
are recommended to consult Wright’s “Court-Hand
Restored.” It not only gives numerous alphabets
and plates, illustrative of the different styles in
vogue at different periods, but has valuable lists of
abbreviations, of ancient place-names, and of debased
Latin words that are only to be found in legal or
monastic documents. Each of the earlier reigns
appears to have had a set or uniform character of
its own; but in the reign of Elizabeth and subsequently,
this clerical mode seems to have been to a
great extent abandoned, and each scribe to have
written after his own fancy. It is hence very noticeable
that, as was remarked by a late keeper of the
Records, “the English records of the 16th and 17th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
centuries are in general more difficult to be read
than the Latin records of preceding ages.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Civil or Domestic Architecture.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Any British, Roman, Danish, or Anglo-Saxon
remains that there may be in the parish, had, perhaps,
better be described before the manorial history
is given. Every earthwork, mound, or ancient roadway
should be carefully noted. It is not possible to
refer to any one, or even three or four, satisfactory
books on such subjects. Fosbrooke’s “Encyclopædia
of Antiquities” is out of date, but we know of no
better compendious work of reference. The two
volumes of Wright’s “Essays on Archæological Subjects,”
will be found of much general use. Worsae’s
“Primeval Antiquities of Denmark,” translated and
applied to the illustration of similar remains in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
England, by W. J. Thoms, may be read with advantage,
but with the recollection that the hard and fast
“ages” of Danish antiquaries are, with greater
knowledge, becoming exploded.</p>

<p>But all description of civil or domestic architecture,
of the Norman or subsequent periods, should
be deferred until after the history of the manor has
been written, because that history will very likely
throw light on any such architectural remains.</p>

<p>If there is a castle, or its relics, within the parish,
the probability is considerable that it has already
been well described by a county historian, or in one
or other of the numerous journals of our Archæological
societies. But it is equally probable that its
history has not been thoroughly written, and special
search should be made with that object at the
P. R. O., beginning with the indexes to the printed
calendars already enumerated. There is no one
efficient volume treating of our mediæval castles that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
corresponds with Viollet-le-Duc’s “Military Architecture
of the Middle Ages,” but a translation of this
French work has been published by Parker, and it
would be well to read either that or the original.</p>

<p>Every effort should be made to identify the old
manor-house, or its site (often marked by a grass
grown moat), and this should of course be done with
each manor, where, as is usually the case, the parish
has contained more than one. Oral tradition, in
this as in other particulars, will often be found a
useful handmaid. Should the exterior of the reputed
manor-house be altogether unpromising, that
should not check further investigation. Several instances
are known to us in which modern brick casing
or sash windows are but a screen to some of the oldest
domestic architecture extant, which may be found
in the back premises or outbuildings, or contain fine
old chimney-pieces, carved oak panelling, or ceilings
of elaborate pargetting. Nor should attention be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
only directed to manor-houses. All old domestic
work is worth chronicling, so rapidly is it disappearing
both in town and country; and the annalist of a
parish should not be above transcribing all the
initials and dates so frequently seen on lintel stones.
As a rule, every house or cottage, not obviously
modern, that has stone buttresses, a moulded wall-plate
or string-course, or bevelled stone mullions to
the windows, is worthy of careful examination.
Many interesting details, such as the site of chantry-houses,
may be thus brought to light, and the history
in stone, and the history on parchment, be found to
tally in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>Domestic architecture should always be described
by the century, and not by the “periods” into which
ecclesiastical architecture is usually divided. The
only book worth purchasing on the subject, is the
somewhat costly but admirable four volume edition
of Parker’s “Mediæval Domestic Architecture.” For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the general “History of Architecture,” both civil and
religious, of all ages and countries, nothing can
surpass Fergusson’s last edition in four volumes,
published by Murray in 1874.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Personal History.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The pedigrees and brief particulars of the Nobility
can be readily found. The most useful standard
works are Dugdale’s “Baronage,” Collins’ “Peerage
and Baronetage,” Banks’ “Dormant and Extinct
Baronage,” and the “Baronagium Genealogicum,”
or pedigrees of English Peers, in five folio volumes,
by Joseph Edmondson. Burke’s “Landed Gentry”
gives much information with respect to the principal
families of commoners, but the earlier genealogical
statements that he prints are often purely mythical.
Several indexes to the many thousands of printed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
pedigrees that are scattered up and down in topographical
and other works have been published, of a
more or less faulty and incomplete description, but a
work of this class, now (1879) in the press, entitled
“The Genealogist’s Guide,” by Mr. George W.
Marshall, promises to be all that can be desired.</p>

<p>But a large portion of family history and pedigree,
which will often be essential to the elucidation of the
monumental history of a parish, to completing the
links in lists of the lords of the manor, or furnishing
particulars with regard to smaller landholders, yet
remains in MS. The most accurate of such MSS.
are at the College of Arms, and are not ordinarily
accessible except on payment of fees; but there is a
fine collection of heraldic visitations at the B. M., the
chief of which are among the Harleian MSS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heralds’ Visitations</span> are said to have commenced
in the reign of Henry IV., but it was not until
20 Henry VIII. that a commission proceeding from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
royal authority was issued. From then until the
latter half of the seventeenth century, visitations
were made every twenty-five or thirty years. The
register books, kept by the heralds and their assistants,
contain the pedigrees and arms of the gentry
of the respective counties, and are often also illustrated
by copies and excerpts from charters and
private documents. Many of these books are lost,
and the rest scattered throughout public and private
libraries. The archives of the College of Arms have
the most important collection, and next comes the
B. M. There are a large number at the B., fifty-four
volumes in the library of Caius College, Cambridge,
and forty in that of the Queen’s College, Oxford.
The earliest heralds’ registers for the counties of
Cornwall, Dorset, Gloucester, Hampshire, Kent,
Notts, Oxford, Surrey, Sussex, Wilts, Worcester,
and Yorks, are of the year 1530; for Berks, Devon,
and Somerset, 1531; for Cheshire and Lancashire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
1533; for Essex and Herts, 1552; for Suffolk,
1561; for Lincoln, 1562; for Leicester, Norfolk,
Stafford, and Warwick, 1563; for Hunts, and Northampton,
1564; for Beds, and Bucks, 1566; for
Derby, Hereford, and Salop, 1569; for Middlesex,
1572; for Cambridge, Durham, and Northumberland,
1575; for Cumberland and Westmoreland,
1615; and for Rutland, 1618. The last visitation
of several counties was taken in 1634, but the majority
were visited in 1662-4; and the last of all
was that of the county of Southampton, made by Sir
Henry St. George, in 1686. The general genealogist
and antiquary cannot but long for the issue of
another royal commission, whereby the heralds might
be empowered, as of old, to destroy all false and self-assumed
arms, whether on carriages, plate, or
monuments.</p>

<p>Sims’ “Index to the Pedigrees and Arms” contained
in the Heralds’ Visitations in the B. M., is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
an accurate and useful book of reference. The
“Manual for the Topographer and Genealogist,” by
the same gentleman, is quite indispensable. Careful
lists of family histories, of all the principal topographical
works, and of all MSS. of worth in public
libraries, are therein classified under the different
counties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wills</span> are too obvious a source of information to
need a word of comment. At Somerset House is
the most important and largest collection, viz., those
of the province of Canterbury. The original wills in
this office begin in 1404, and the transcripts in 1383.
They are complete only from December, 1660. In
the office at York, for that province, the wills begin
in 1590, and the transcripts in 1389. Owing to the
probate privileges enjoyed by the various ecclesiastical
courts, there were not only registries for wills
in every diocese, but numerous peculiar and exempt
jurisdictions in each diocese. The dates at which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
wills begin in the different minor registries are so
very varied, and their condition and facilities, or even
possibilities, of search so multifarious, that it is
impossible to give any useful abstract. The Report
on Public Records for 1837, and Sir Harris Nicolas’
“Notitia Historica,” should be consulted. The
power of probate was taken away from the ecclesiastical
courts by the Act of 1857.</p>

<p>The little-known <span class="smcap">Recusant Rolls</span> of the time of
Elizabeth, give information as to the humblest as
well as the wealthiest parishioner who refused to
attend the services of the Established Church.
These, and many other similar class of documents,
relative to the fining and other grievous penalties
attached to profession of the Roman Catholic faith,
extending up to a recent date, are to be found at
the P. R. O.</p>

<p>Records of <span class="smcap">Attainders</span>, <span class="smcap">Forfeitures</span>, <span class="smcap">Sequestrations</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Pardons</span>, some from the time of Edward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
II., will also be found at the same office, and may be
consulted with advantage by those tracing personal
history, if there is any cause to suspect their complicity
in any of the multitude of baronial feuds,
rebellions, or religious persecutions that led to the
existence of so large a class of offenders. Sims’
“Manual” should be consulted for exhaustive lists of
this class of documents, as well as for numerous lists
of <span class="smcap">Gentry</span> and <span class="smcap">Freeholders</span> of different dates, pertaining
to their respective counties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muster Rolls</span>, which give the names, rank, dwelling,
and often other particulars, of those able to
bear arms in each county, may be of interest to the
local historian. The earliest of these returns, now
at the P. R. O., are of the reign of Henry III.; there
are great deficiencies up to the time of Henry VIII.,
but from that reign to the time of Charles II, they
are very voluminous. Lists of <span class="smcap">Sheriffs</span>, <span class="smcap">Members
of Parliament</span>, and <span class="smcap">Mayors of Boroughs</span>, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
been printed for almost every county from an early
date, and can readily be found at public libraries.
The names of lords of the manor, or other individuals
connected with the special parish treated of, should
always be collated with such lists, in order to see if
they held any of these important offices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">County Records.</span> The various documents that
are or ought to be in charge of the Clerk of the
Peace, relative to all the multifarious business transacted
at Quarter Sessions, contain much that is of
value relative to personal or local history. But it
would only be tantalising to enumerate the different
class of records that should be in the custody of the
county officials, for in the great majority of cases
they are in so much confusion as to be practically
useless for any literary purpose. Among the exceptions
may be mentioned Leicestershire and Derbyshire,
in the latter of which counties they have been
recently admirably arranged; and also, to a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
extent, Devonshire, the salient points of whose
records have lately been published—see “Quarter
Sessions from Queen Elizabeth to Queen Anne,” by
A. H. Hamilton, a volume that aptly illustrates local
government, and which is useful as showing the
class of information that may be gleaned from such
documents. They do not, as a rule, extend further
back than the time of Elizabeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Borough Records.</span> These are in many instances
of great antiquity; some charters going back to the
time of John. But their condition and value are
much varied, and there is no trustworthy general
report. It is hoped that a “Borough Records
Society” will soon be formed for the publication of
our Municipal Archives.</p>

<p>In the six Reports already issued by the Historical
Manuscripts Commission the Archives of the following
English boroughs have been reported on:—Abingdon,
Axbridge, Berwick-on-Tweed, Bridgewater,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Bridport, Cambridge, Coventry, Dartmouth, Faversham,
Folkestone, Fordwich, High Wycombe, Hythe,
Kingston-on-Thames, Launceston, Lydd, Morpeth,
New Romney, Norwich, Nottingham, Rye, St. Albans,
Sandwich, Tenterden, Totnes, Wallingford, Wells,
Weymouth, Winchester, and York.</p>

<p>The Report of the Municipal Corporation Commissioners,
1835, gives certain information, more or less
meagre, of all boroughs. See also Merewether and
Stephen’s “History of the Boroughs and Municipal
Corporations of the United Kingdom.”</p>

<p>Under the head of <span class="smcap">Worthies</span> it may be worth
while to consider whether the parish has ever had
amongst its residents, or on its baptismal registers,
the names of men of marked celebrity in any walk of
life. Nuttall’s edition of Fuller’s “Worthies of England,”
published in 1840, in three vols. 8vo., Wood’s
“Athenæ,” and any good Biographical Dictionaries
(<i>e.g.</i> Chalmers’), should be consulted.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Parochial Records.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Foremost under this head come <span class="smcap">Parish Registers</span>.
Burn’s “History of Parish Registers in England” is
the standard work on this subject. The first mandate
for keeping registers of baptisms, marriages,
and burials, in each parish was issued in 1538, but
it is quite the exception to find registers of this early
date. This mandate was repeated in more rigorous
terms on the accession of Elizabeth, 1558, but not
being regularly observed, it was ordained in 1597
that parchment register books should be purchased
at the expense of each parish, and that all the names
from the older books (mostly of paper) should be
therein transcribed from 1558; hence it happens
that so many parish registers begin with that year.
It was at the same time ordered that copies of the
registers should be annually forwarded to the episcopal
registrar, to be preserved in the episcopal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
archives. This injunction, however, was so imperfectly
carried out, and the duplicates when forwarded
were so carelessly kept, that the diocesan copies of
registers are mere fragments of what they should be,
and are in several cases still in such confusion as to
be practically inaccessible. The earliest transcripts
at Lincoln begin in 1587, and at Gloucester in 1571,
but there are few dioceses that have any earlier than
1660.</p>

<p>Many parishes have lost their early registers, and
they are usually deficient or wanting during the
Commonwealth. Official inquiries were made of all
the clergy in 1831, as to the exact date, condition,
and number of the parish registers in their custody,
and abstracts of their replies were published in a
Blue Book in 1833. But it is not generally known
that the returns themselves, often containing more
information than was printed, are at the British
Museum (Add. MSS. 9,335, etc.). The dates there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
given are not, however, to be implicitly relied upon,
as unfortunately some registers have been lost or
stolen since that date, whilst others of an earlier
date have happily, in some cases, been restored or
discovered in the like period.</p>

<p>Registers should be carefully looked through, not
only for the purpose of extracting the names of
prominent or interesting families, but also for the
purpose of gleaning the innumerable little scraps of
local information that were not unfrequently interpolated
in the earlier pages, such as notes pertaining
to excommunication, licenses for eating flesh in Lent,
penance, remarkable or eccentric characters, storms,
and weather observations, inventories of church
goods, visitations of the plague or sweating sickness,
national events, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Many of the clergy and others find a difficulty in
reading the earlier registers. Reference has already
been made to Wright’s “Court-Hand Restored,” but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the greatest help in deciphering them will be the
recollection that most of the letters of the ordinary
hand of Elizabeth and the Stuarts, which differ from
those now in use, are the same as those of the present
German written characters, <i>e.g.</i>, the letters “h”
and “r.” A few days’ steady practice in transcribing
old writing, beginning with the letters and
words that can easily be read, ought to be sufficient
to master the stiffest hands in parochial records.</p>

<p>In case there are any old Meeting Houses, or congregations
of Independents, Presbyterians, Quakers,
or other nonconformists in the parish, it will be well,
with regard to these registers, to consult a Blue
Book issued in 1841, called “Lists of Non-parochial
Registers and Records in the custody of the Registrar-General,”
wherein a county classification is
observed; also a “Report on Non-parochial Registers,”
issued in 1857, wherein are enumerated those
registers of the sects that were still in private custody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span><span class="smcap">Churchwardens’ Accounts</span>, giving particulars of
rates, receipts, and payments for church purposes,
are often highly interesting, and should be carefully
preserved. Sometimes they are found entered in
bound volumes, but more often tied up in bundles or
tumbled in confusion in the parish chest. Still more
often they are altogether missing. They can occasionally
be recovered from the private dwellings of
present or past churchwardens. The earliest with
which we are acquainted, are those of All Saints’,
Derby, which begin in 1465, but they rarely are
found prior to the Restoration.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Constables Accounts</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Accounts of
the Overseers of the Poor</span>, will also sometimes be
met with, beginning from a comparatively remote
date, and will amply repay close attention. They
throw a similar light on the secular history of a
parish to that thrown on the religious history by the
Churchwardens’ Accounts. The thorough overhauling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
of the parish chest, or other receptacles of parish
papers, and the classification of their contents is
strongly recommended, even where it seems to be
most unpromising of results. There is no reason
why even such apparently trivial things as the
indentures of parish apprentices (which have the
seals and signatures of Justices of the Peace), should
not be preserved, neatly arranged, and docketted.
Every scrap of paper of past generations, showing
the inner working of parochial life, possesses some
interest of its own; and future generations will
thank us for their preservation. Moreover, a careful
arrangement of parish papers often meets with more
immediate reward. We have ourselves found missing
portions of 16th century registers, highly interesting
deeds as early as the 14th century, royal
proclamations and special forms of prayer, <i>temp.</i>
Elizabeth and James I., in parochial litter put aside
as valueless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Of what can be gleaned from these parish annals
when tolerably perfect, we may be permitted to quote
that which we have elsewhere written respecting the
records of Youlgreave, a Derbyshire village, that
have recently been classified with some care:—</p>

<p>“The future historian of this parish will find a
vast stock of material ready to hand; and if such a
work was ever accomplished it would once more be
seen how the history of even a remote village is but
the history of the nation in little; how national
victories were announced on the church bells, and
national disasters by the proclamation of a form of
prayer; how local self-government became gradually
developed in the office of justice, constable, and overseer
of the poor; how the press-gang worked its cruel
way to man the ships and fill the regiments of the
Georges; how the good folk of Youlgreave sent forth
a spy to watch the movements of Charles Edward in
1745; and how they prepared to defend themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
by giving their constable a new bill-head, and repairing
his old one; how unmerciful was the treatment
of lunatics: and how free was the consumption of
ale, on the smallest possible provocation, at the
parish’s expense; these, and a thousand other
minutiæ, all of them possessing some point of interest,
can be gleaned from these annals of a parish,
to say nothing of the perfect genealogy of nearly
every family, together with an account of their
varying circumstances, that might be constructed by
their aid.”</p>

<p>The fullest and best information respecting the
parish as a unit of the national life, with much that
pertains to the history of its various officers from
the earliest times, will be found in Toulmin Smith’s
“The Parish; its powers and obligations.” The
second and best edition was published in 1857 by
H. Sweet, Chancery Lane.</p>

<p>The history of the village and village officers have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
not hitherto received the attention they deserve, for
all our municipalities have developed out of village
communities, and their various officials are but those
of the petty rural parish adapted to the needs of an
urban population. It will be well on this point to
refer to the useful “Index of Municipal Offices,”
with an historical introduction, recently published
by G. Laurence Gomme.</p>

<p>Lists of parochial <span class="smcap">Charities</span> are sometimes found
in the parish chest, and more frequently on bequest
boards in the church; but the local annotator should
not consider that he has got a perfect or correct list
until the elaborate reports of the Charity Commissioners,
compiled some fifty years ago, have been
consulted. In 1843, a most useful Blue Book was
published for each county, being an analytical digest
of the voluminous reports arranged under parishes.
Topographical booksellers can generally procure
copies of these, by which a great saving of time will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
be effected. There are later Reports with regard to
Endowed Schools.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i067.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">History of the Church.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, or pre-Norman charters,
occasionally give definite information of a
church in a particular parish or district, but as a rule
the earliest mention of the parish church will be
found in the previously described <span class="smcap">Domesday Book</span>.
But the Commissioners, not being specially instructed
to make returns of churches, acted on their own
judgment, and in some counties omitted them partially,
and in others altogether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taxatio Ecclesiastica P. Nicholai IV.</span>—Pope
Nicholas IV. (to whose predecessors in the See of
Rome the first-fruits and tenths of all ecclesiastical
benefices had for a long time been paid) granted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
tenths, in 1288, to Edward I. for six years, towards
defraying the expenses of a Crusade; and that they
might be collected to their full value, the King caused
a valuation roll to be drawn up, which was completed
in 1291, under the direction of John, Bishop
of Winchester, and Oliver, Bishop of Lincoln. There
are two copies of this Roll at the P. R. O., both of
which appear to have been written in the reign of
Henry IV., and there is a third, which is by far the
oldest, among the Cottonian MSS. of the B. M.
These three copies were collated and printed in a
folio volume by the Record Commission in 1802.
There are one or two other old copies of this Roll in
private libraries; one in the Chapter Library, Lichfield;
and another, in excellent condition, in the
muniment room of Lincoln Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valor Ecclesiasticus.</span> The taxation of 1291 held
good, and all the taxes from the benefices, as well to
our Kings as to the Popes, were regulated by it until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
27 Henry VIII., when a new survey was completed.
Henceforth the first-fruits and tenths ceased to be
forwarded to Rome, and were transferred to the
Crown. In 1703 the receipts were appropriated,
under the title of Queen Anne’s Bounty, to the augmentation
of the smaller livings. The original
returns of the King’s Valor are at the P. R. O. They
were officially published in six folio volumes between
the years 1811 and 1834. In the latter year an
“Introduction” of no little value, was also published
in an 8vo. volume, written by the Rev. Joseph
Hunter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Certificates of Colleges and Chantries.</span> About
ten years after the completion of his ecclesiastical
survey, Henry VIII. decided on appropriating the
revenues belonging to Collegiate Churches and
Chantries. As a preliminary measure to their sale,
he appointed a commission, in the 37th year of his
reign, to re-value this property, and to take an inventory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of the chattels. The whole subject of the
suppression of the Chantries, as conceived by
Henry VIII. and finally carried out by Edward VI.,
is ably and exhaustively treated in the introduction
to the volumes of the Cheetham Society, which treat
of the Lancashire Chantries. The reports, or
“Certificates,” furnished by Henry’s Commission
with respect to the different chantries, are preserved
at the P. R. O., and are entered on rolls arranged in
eight parallel columns, in answer to a like number
of queries. There are also abridged rolls on paper
of some counties. Further information about chantries
may be sometimes gleaned from certain MS.
volumes at the P. R. O., entitled “<i>Particulars for
the Sale of Colleges and Chantries</i>.” In the B. M.
(Add. MSS. 8,102) is a valuable roll of Fees, Corrodies,
and Pensions, paid to members of the suppressed
chantries and religious houses, out of the Exchequer,
2 and 3 Philip and Mary. The pensions for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
different counties are on separate skins, so that it is
easy of reference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inventories of Church Goods.</span> There are various
Inventories of Church Goods in the P. R. O., taken
by Commission at the beginning of the reign of
Edward VI., some on detached slips of parchment,
others in paper books. The inventories are not
absolutely perfect for all parishes in any one county;
in several counties the churches of one or more
Hundreds are missing; for others, such as Somerset,
Sussex, and the North Riding of Yorkshire, there
are none extant. Nor are there any for Lincolnshire;
but there is a MS. return of Church Furniture
and Ornaments of 150 churches of that
county, taken in 1566, in the Episcopal Registry at
Lincoln. This was published in 1866, by Edward
Peacock, F.S.A. There are also some special Inventories
connected with other dioceses, which space
forbids us to mention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span><span class="smcap">Guilds and Fraternities.</span> Guilds and Fraternities
of a more or less religious character, and usually
directly connected with a special altar at the parish
church, will naturally come under the history of the
Church, provided any can be detected in connection
with the particular parish. It used to be supposed
that these guilds were only found in cities or
boroughs, but later researches show that they also
occasionally existed in quite small villages. The
Parliament of 1381 directed writs to be sent to the
sheriffs of each county, calling upon them to see
that the Master and Wardens of all Guilds and
Brotherhoods made returns to the King’s Council
in Chancery of all details pertaining to the foundation,
statutes, and property of their guilds. A
large number of the original returns (549) still
remain in the P. R. O., where they are known as
“Miscellaneous Rolls, Tower Records, Bundles
cccviii. ix. x.” For some counties there are none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
extant, and for others only those from a single
Hundred. More than one hundred of these returns
have recently been printed or analysed, by Toulmin
Smith, in a volume of the Early English Text
Society, entitled “English Gilds.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heraldic Church Notes.</span> In the different heraldic
visitation books, especially those <i>temp.</i> Elizabeth,
which have been previously described, there often
occur interesting church notes, which not only detail
heraldic glass in the windows and arms on the
monuments, but also occasionally give inscriptions
that have long since disappeared. These can only
be found by a careful inspection of the heralds’
register books of the county in which the parish is
situated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Commonwealth Survey.</span> In pursuance of various
ordinances of the Parliament, a complete survey of
the possessions of Bishops, Deans, and Chapters, and
of all benefices, was made in 1650, by specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
appointed Commissioners. These interesting returns,
filling twenty-one large folio volumes, are in
the library of Lambeth Palace, and numbered in
the catalogue of MSS. from 902 to 922. These
surveys have hitherto been singularly overlooked
by county historians and ecclesiologists, though occasional
extracts have been published from a much-abbreviated
and inaccurate summary, based on these
documents, which forms No. 459 of the Lansdowne
MSS. in the B. M.</p>

<p>The Record Books of the Commonwealth Commissioners
for augmenting Rectories and Vicarages
(MSS. 966-1,021); the original Presentations to
various benefices from 1652 to 1659 (MSS. 944-7);
and Counterparts of leases of Church Lands, made
by authority of Parliament from 1652 to 1658
(MSS. 948-50), are also in Lambeth Library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Briefs.</span> Royal Letters Patent, authorising collections
for charitable purposes within churches, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
termed “Briefs.” Lists of them, from the time of
Elizabeth downwards, are often to be found on the
fly-leaves of old register books, or in churchwardens’
accounts. The repair or rebuilding of churches in
post-Reformation days, until nearly the beginning of
the Catholic Revival, was almost invariably effected
by this method. About the middle of last century,
owing to the growing frequency of Briefs, it was
ordered that they should only be granted on the
formal application of Quarter Sessions. Much information
as to the condition of the fabrics and other
particulars relative to churches can be gathered from
the petitions to Quarter Sessions, in those counties
where the documents are accessible. The Briefs
themselves were issued from the Court of Chancery,
so we suppose they would be attainable at the
P. R. O. At the B. M. is a large collection of original
Briefs, from 1754 down to their abolition in 1828.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
They were presented to the Museum in 1829, by Mr.
J. Stevenson Salt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Advowson.</span> The history of the advowson, if the
living remained a rectory, was almost invariably
intermixed with that of the manor or the moieties of
the manor. Consequently it will be found, that, in
the case of rectories, various particulars as to the
owners of the advowson, and its value, at different
periods, can be gleaned from the Inquisitions, and from
the Patent and Close Rolls to which references have
already been made; or, in the case of litigation, from
the Plea Rolls and Year Books. If the living became
at any time a Vicarage, care should be taken to look
through the particulars given by Dugdale and Tanner,
of the religious house to which the big tithes were
appropriated, and more especially to carefully search
the chartularies of that establishment, if any are
extant. There is an excellent list of the various
monastic Chartularies, <i>i.e.</i>, ancient parchment books,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
containing transcripts or abstracts of the charters of
the different houses, in the first two volumes of
Nichols’ “Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica,”
and a shorter one in Sims’ “Manual.”</p>

<p>The Ordination of a Vicarage, <i>i.e.</i>, the official appropriation
of certain parts of the endowment for
the sustentation of a vicar, required episcopal confirmation;
and these ordinations will usually be found
in the Episcopal Registers, if they are extant for the
date when the rectory was formally appropriated.
These ordinations often contain information of great
interest, and have hitherto been very rarely searched
for, and still more rarely printed.</p>

<p>The terms used in these documents for different
sorts of tithes, for the various produce of the soil,
etc., etc., will be sought for in vain in any ordinary
Latin Dictionary; for their explanation it will be
necessary to consult a Glossary of mediæval or monastic
terms. The most handy and accurate is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
abridged edition of the Glossaries of Du Cange, Du
Fresne, etc., in six vols. 8vo., published at Halle,
between 1722-1784. Some such work will also be
found indispensable in consulting the monastic
Chartularies and many of the Records and Rolls.
The majority of the terms will be found in the last
two editions of Cowel’s “Interpreter,” 1708, and
1737, which can much more readily be met with
than the larger glossaries; but there is great need
for a one volume compendious glossary, and it is
hoped that such a work may shortly be published.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lists of Incumbents.</span> Lists of rectors and vicars,
giving the date of their institution, and the names of
their respective patrons, are indispensable to a complete
parochial history. They are, for the most part,
to be obtained from the diocesan registers. This
work, in several dioceses, will be found to involve no
small labour, for Bishop’s registrars were not always
particular to separate institutions from other Episcopal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
acts, and occasionally placed them in precise
chronological order for the whole diocese, without
any regard to archdeaconries and other minor divisions.
But the trouble will be amply repaid by the
numerous quaint and interesting little details that
the searcher will be almost sure to discover. Many
of our episcopal registers, or act books, are of supreme
interest, and yet they are perhaps less known than
any class of original documents. The dates at which
these registers begin average about the year 1300.
We give, for the first time in any manual, their
respective initial years:—Canterbury, 1279; London,
1306; Winchester, 1282; Ely 1336; Lincoln,
1217; Lichfield, 1296; Wells, 1309; Salisbury,
1296; Exeter, 1257; Norwich, 1299; Worcester,
1268; Hereford, 1275; Chichester, 1397; Rochester,
1319; York, 1214; and Carlisle, 1292. The old
registers of Durham are mostly lost, that of Bishop
Kellaw, 1311-18, being the oldest. None of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Welsh Cathedrals have any registers older than the
16th century.</p>

<p>Gaps are not unusual in the episcopal registers for
some time subsequent to the Reformation, when the
books were often kept in a slovenly fashion. These
deficiencies can be generally supplied from the lists
of institutions in the Augmentation Books at the
P. R. O.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that no list of incumbents
should be considered complete, until it has been
carefully collated with the parish registers.</p>

<p>Catalogues of all the English Bishops are to be
found in Canon Stubbs’s “<i>Registrum Sacrum Anglicanum</i>;”
and similar lists of Deans, Prebendaries,
and minor dignitaries, in Hardy’s edition of Le Neve’s
“<i>Fasti Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ</i>.” Both of these works
may probably be useful when drawing up the list of
parish priests.</p>

<p>Lists of priests appointed to the more important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
chantries can usually also be extracted from the
diocesan registers, for, except in peculiar circumstances,
they required episcopal institution.</p>

<p>Any facts of interest or importance that can be
ascertained respecting the successive incumbents
should be chronicled. For the time of the Commonwealth,
Walker’s “Sufferings of the Clergy” on the
one hand, and Calamy’s “Ejected Ministers” on the
other, should be consulted. They both make mention
of a very great number of the clergy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dedication.</span> The dedication of the church should
never be taken for granted from county gazetteers
or directories. Dedications to All Saints, and to the
Blessed Virgin, should be viewed with some suspicion
until firmly established, for in the time of Henry VIII.
the dedication festivals, or “wakes,” were often
transferred to All Saints’ Day, or Lady Day, in order
to avoid a multiplicity of holidays, and hence by
degrees the real dedication became forgotten. Ecton’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
“<i>Thesaurus Rerum Ecclesiasticarum</i>” (1742), and
Bacon’s “<i>Liber Regis</i>” (1786), should be consulted
for dedications. Occasionally the patron saints of
the different churches are mentioned in the institutions
in the episcopal registers, and more often in
monastic chartularies; but the surest of all references,
in the case of a doubtful dedication, is to look
up the pre-Reformation wills of the lords of the
manor or other chief people of the parish. These
wills almost invariably contain an early clause to
this effect:—“I leave my body to be buried within
the church of St. ——.” The time of the wakes or
village feast is a good guide to the dedication, but
one which, from the reason stated above, as well as
from other causes, must not be implicitly relied
upon.</p>

<p>Another point worth remembering with regard to
dedications, is that re-consecration was not of unfrequent
occurrence. Murder and some other crimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
within the church, as well as special violations of
the altar, rendered re-consecration imperative; and
it was also often resorted to when the fabric was
altogether or considerably rebuilt, or even when a
new chancel was added. At the time of these re-consecrations,
it occasionally happened that the name
of the patron saint was changed, not from mere
caprice or love of novelty, but because relics of that
particular saint were obtained for inclosure in the
chief or high altar. This should be borne in mind
when a discrepancy is found in the name of the
patron saint of the same church at different epochs.</p>

<p>The chapter of Parker’s “Calendar of the Anglican
Church,” entitled “A few remarks on the dedication
of English Churches,” is worth reading. This book
is also valuable for the brief account of the saints
most frequently met with in England, both in dedications
and otherwise. The first half of the book
has been re-published once or twice, under the title<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
of “Calendar of the Prayer Book,” but it leaves out
the chapters here mentioned, and is comparatively
valueless as compared with the edition of 1851.
Harington “On the Consecration of Churches,”
published by Rivington in 1844, should also be read.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Description of the Church.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Having finished the history of the Church, it will
be best to follow it up by a description of the fabric
of the Church, and of all its details.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Styles of Architecture.</span> In deciding as to the
different “periods” under which to classify the
various styles into which almost every parish church
is more or less divided, it is perhaps wisest to confine
oneself to the simple and generally accepted divisions
of English architecture, originally adopted by Mr.
Rickman, viz. (1) the Saxon, from 800 to 1066; (2)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
the Norman, from 1066 to 1145; (3) the Early
English, from 1145 to 1272; (4) the Decorated, from
1272 to 1377; and (5) the Perpendicular, from 1377
to 1509. Some competent writers always speak of
three periods of Transition, covering the reigns of
Henry II., Edward I., and Richard II.; whilst
others, and this may be well adopted, speak of only
one regular “Transition,” meaning by that term the
period between the Early English and Decorated, or
the reign of Edward I. (1272-1307).</p>

<p>These divisions are generally accepted as sufficing
for popular purposes; but of the more detailed and
technical divisions of later writers, there are none so
correct in nomenclature, and so accurate in separation
of style, as the seven periods of Mr. Edmund
Sharpe. The first and second of his periods are the
same as given above, but the third is styled the
Transitional, from 1145 to 1190; the fourth, the
Lancet, from 1190 to 1245; the fifth, the Geometrical,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
from 1245 to 1315; the sixth, the Curvilinear, from
1315 to 1360; and the seventh, the Rectilinear, from
1360 to 1550. See Sharpe’s “Seven Periods of English
Architecture,” with its excellent series of plates.</p>

<p>There are numerous architectural manuals, but
Parker’s “Glossary of Gothic Architecture” has not
been surpassed, and is very comprehensive. The
best edition is the fourth, with the two additional
volumes of plates.</p>

<p>Before classifying the different parts of the building
according to the various periods, a most careful
inspection should be made of both inner and outer
walls, when fragments of mouldings, pertaining
possibly to an earlier church than any now standing,
may not unfrequently be detected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monuments.</span> Inscriptions on monuments now
missing, or partly obliterated, may sometimes be
recovered from the Church Notes of Heraldic Visitations,
or other MS. note books of ecclesiologists of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
past generations, in which some counties are peculiarly
fortunate. For a list of MSS. of this description,
that may be found in our public libraries,
arranged under counties, see Sims’ “Manual.” It
may also be useful to refer to two printed works—Le
Neve’s “<i>Monumenta Anglicana</i>,” 5 vols. 8vo.
(1717-1719), and Weever’s “Ancient Funerall
Monuments,” the latest edition of which, with additions,
is a 4to. vol. of 1767. The former gives
inscriptions on monuments of eminent persons who
deceased between 1600 and 1718, the latter treats
generally of all monuments in the dioceses of Canterbury,
Rochester, London, and Norwich. Bloxam,
on “Monumental Architecture” (1834), is a useful
handbook on the general subject of monuments.</p>

<p>Cutts’ “Manual of Sepulchral Slabs and Crosses”
is the only book dealing with the interesting subject of
early <span class="allsmcap">INCISED SLABS</span>. It is well done, but much more
has come to light on the subject since it was written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
(1849), and a new manual is much wanted. In some
counties, where stone abounds, remains of this
description are found in most churches. If any part
of the church is being rebuilt, the debris should be
most carefully looked over; and a minute inspection
of the existing masonry will often detect more or less
perfect specimens of incised crosses that have been
utilised in the masonry by the church restorers of
past generations. The lintels of the windows (especially
of the clerestory and of the tower), the inner
side of the parapets or battlements, the stone seats
of the porch, and of course the whole of the flooring,
should be critically scanned for these relics. See
also Boutell’s “Christian Monuments.”</p>

<p>Haines’ “Manual of Monumental <span class="smcap">Brasses</span>” (2 vols.
8vo., 1861) is the best book on that class of memorials.
The second volume consists of a fairly
exhaustive list of brasses throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>There is no good handbook dealing exclusively with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">STONE EFFIGIES</span>, a great desideratum; the big illustrated
folios of Gough’s “Sepulchral Monuments,”
and Stothard’s “Monumental Effigies,” may be consulted
with advantage. For the details of <span class="allsmcap">ARMOUR</span>,
Hewitt’s “Ancient Armour and Weapons in Europe”
(3 vols) is the most exhaustive work; for the details
of <span class="allsmcap">COSTUME</span> there are several expensive works, but
the best handbook is Fairholt’s “Costume in England,”
to which is appended an illustrated glossary
of terms.</p>

<p>In connection with stained or painted <span class="smcap">Glass</span>,
Winston’s “Hints on Glass Painting” (2nd edition,
1867) should be read, wherein the different styles of
successive periods are critically distinguished and
illustrated.</p>

<p>For the important item of <span class="smcap">Heraldry</span>, both in glass
and on monuments, the best of the numerous
manuals (and there are several very trashy) is
Cussan’s “Handbook of Heraldry.” Burke’s “General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Armoury,” of which a new and extended edition
was published in 1878, is a dictionary of arms classified
under families. Papworth’s “Dictionary of
British Armorials” is arranged on the opposite principle,
viz., the blazonry or description of the arms is
given first, and the name of the family or families to
which it pertains follows. It is an expensive work,
but indispensable in the identification of arms. It
will also be found to be far more accurate than
Burke, and gives references to the various rolls and
other MSS. from which the arms are cited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fonts</span> are almost a speciality in themselves.
Simpson’s “Series of Ancient Baptismal Fonts,”
1825, has a large number of beautifully finished
plates of the more remarkable examples. Paley’s
“Baptismal Font,” 1844, has illustrations and
critical descriptions of a great number, arranged
alphabetically. See also the “Archæologia,” vols.
x. and xi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span><span class="smcap">Bells</span> have now a literature of their own. Ellacombe’s
“Bells of the Church,” and Fowler’s “Bells
and Bell-ringing” are admirable works. The inscriptions,
etc., on the church bells of the majority of
English counties have already been published, and
most of the remainder are now in progress. North’s
“Bells of Leicestershire,” and “Bells of Northamptonshire,”
are the best books of their class, but the
“Bells of Derbyshire,” now in course of publication
in the “Reliquary,” and chiefly contributed by St.
John Hope, are being yet more thoroughly treated,
both in description and illustration.</p>

<p>Church <span class="smcap">Plate</span> should always be inspected, and the
date, character, inscription, or arms on each piece
carefully recorded. Chaffers’ “Hall Marks on Plate”
gives the fullest description of the different marks,
and how the precise date can be thereby ascertained.
The fifth edition, published in 1875, is a considerable
improvement on its predecessors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span><span class="smcap">Inventories of Church Goods</span> often need explanation,
or remains of various ancient church furniture
may make some description necessary. There is no
one book that can be thoroughly recommended on
this subject; but, perhaps, the most satisfactory in
some respects is Walcott’s “Sacred Archæology,” a
popular dictionary of ecclesiastical art and institutions.
Jules Corblet’s “Manuel Elémentaire
d’Archéologie Nationale” may be consulted with
advantage; it is a better done work than anything
of the size and scope in English, and is well illustrated.
For the various details of Church worship
and ceremonies, reference should be made to Rock’s
“Church of our Fathers,” and to Chambers’ valuable
work, “Divine Worship in England in the Thirteenth
and Fourteenth Centuries, contrasted with and
adapted to that in the Nineteenth.”</p>

<p>Before beginning the description of the Church, it
will be well, in the first place, in order to ensure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
clearness and accuracy, that some general <span class="allsmcap">PLAN OF
PROCEDURE</span> should be adopted. We give the following
skeleton of a suggested outline, that has been proved
to be useful and orderly, but it can, of course, be
altered or expanded or re-arranged in any direction.</p>

<p>1. Enumeration of component parts of structure,
remarks as to its general or special characteristics.</p>

<p>2 Ground plan, <i>i.e.</i>, dimensions of area of chancel,
nave, etc., different levels, and number of chancel
and altar steps.</p>

<p>3. Description of parts of the permanent structure
that are (<i>a</i>) Saxon, (<i>b</i>) Norman, (<i>c</i>) Early English,
(<i>d</i>) Transition, (<i>e</i>) Decorated, (<i>f</i>) Perpendicular,
(<i>g</i>) Debased, (<i>h</i>) Churchwarden, and (<i>i</i>) Restored.
Some definite order should be observed under each
head, otherwise it is likely that some details may
escape, <i>e.g.</i> doorways, windows, piers, arches, etc.,
of chancel, nave, aisles, porches, transepts, tower,
and chapels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>4. External details—parapets, gurgoyles, niches,
stoup, arms, inscriptions, “low side windows.”</p>

<p>5. Internal details—[Stone] altar or altar stone,
piscina, almery, hagioscope, Easter or sepulchral
recess, niches, brackets, roof-corbels, and sedilia of
(<i>a</i>) chancel, (<i>b</i>) south aisle, (<i>c</i>) north aisle, and (<i>d</i>)
chapels or transepts; also groined roofs, doorway or
steps to roodloft, and stone screens—[Wood] altar
table, altar rails, reading desk, lectern, pulpit, pews,
benches, poppy-heads, panelling, roofs, doors, galleries,
rood or chancel screen, other screens or parcloses,
parish or vestment chests, alms boxes—[Iron
or other metal]—any old details.</p>

<p>6. Font—(<i>a</i>) position, (<i>b</i>) description, (<i>c</i>) measurements,
(<i>d</i>) cover.</p>

<p>7. Monuments—beginning with early incised
stones, and carefully following them down in chronological
order, an order which should not be broken
except for the purpose of keeping a family group<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
together. Arms should be correctly blazoned, and
inscriptions faithfully copied.</p>

<p>8. Stained glass, according to age.</p>

<p>9. Encaustic tiles—pavement generally.</p>

<p>10. Fresco paintings, black-letter texts, patterns
on roof or elsewhere, royal arms, charity bequest
boards.</p>

<p>11. Bells—(<i>a</i>) number, (<i>b</i>) inscription and marks,
(<i>c</i>) frame, (<i>d</i>) remarkable peals, or bell-ringers
rhymes, (<i>e</i>) legends; also sanctus bell, or bell cote
on nave gable.</p>

<p>12. Parish registers and other documents; church
books, or library.</p>

<p>13. Church plate.</p>

<p>14. Church yard, (<i>a</i>) cross, (<i>b</i>) remarkable monuments
or epitaphs, (<i>c</i>) yew tree, (<i>d</i>) lychgate, (<i>e</i>)
sundial.</p>

<p>15. More recent fittings or ornaments, such as
altar appurtenances, organ, etc.; the previous headings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
being supposed to be confined to older details
possessing some historic value. But if the date, or
probable date, is given of each particular, it might
perhaps be as well to describe everything (if a complete
account up to date is desired) under its proper
head; thus a modern altar cross and candlesticks
might be mentioned under the 5th head.</p>

<p>A few words on church “<span class="smcap">Restoration</span>” may be
here introduced; for it cannot surely be inappropriate
to include a sentence or two in these pages
(whose object it is to further the preservation of local
records), that may possibly have some small influence
in preventing the needless destruction of any
part of those noble buildings round which the history
of each English parish so closely clusters. From
the standpoint of a local annalist nothing has been
more painful in the “restorations” of the past forty
years than the wanton way in which monuments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
and more especially flat tombstones, of all ages, have
been often treated.</p>

<p>It is necessary to enter a warm protest against the
notion that any honour can be paid to God, or respect
to the memory of those that He created in His own
image, by burying inscribed gravestones beneath
many inches of concrete in order to stick therein the
glossy tiles of recent manufacture. The effacing or
removal (wherever it can be avoided) of the memorials
of the dead should in all cases be strongly
resisted, no matter what be the eminence of the
architect that recommends it. There are not many
unrestored churches left in the country, but there
are some of much value and interest for whose fate
we tremble. When a “restoration” (the term is a
necessity for the lack of a better) is contemplated, let
it be recollected that all work—beyond the removal
of galleries, and modern fittings, the opening out of
flat plaster ceilings, above which good timber roofs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
often lie concealed, the scraping off the accumulated
layers of whitewash and paint, the letting in of light
through blocked-up windows, the allowing of feet to
pass through doorways closed in recent days by the
mason or bricklayer, and the making strong of really
perishing parts—all work beyond this is in great
danger of destroying the traces of the historic continuity
of our Church, and of doing a damage that
can never be repaired. And in preserving this historic
continuity, let it not be thought that any service
is being rendered to history or religion by sweeping
clean out of the church all fittings of a post-Reformation
date. The sturdy Elizabethan benches, the
well-carved Jacobean pulpit, or the altar rails of
beaten iron of last century, should all be preserved
as memorials of their respective periods; in short,
everything that our forefathers gave to God’s service
that was costly and good, should be by us preserved,
provided that it does not mar the devout ritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
ordered by the Common Prayer, or in other respects
interfere with the Church’s due proclaiming of her
Divine mission to the nineteenth century. The
reaction against over-restoration is now happily
setting in, but a word of caution is also necessary
lest that cry should be adopted as the cloak of a lazy
indifferentism, or be used as an excuse for regarding
the parish church as a local museum illustrative of
byegone times, to be carefully dusted and nothing
more. Where much new work, or any considerable
extent of refitting, seem absolutely necessary, it is
best to hasten slowly, and to do a little well rather
than to aim at a speedy general effect. Thus, if one
of our old grey churches requires fresh seating, how
much better to fill a single aisle or one bay of the
nave with sound and effectively carved oak, and only
repair the remainder, rather than to accomplish the
whole in sticky pine. The best material and the
best art should surely be used in God’s service, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
not reserved to feed our pride or minister to our
comfort in private dwellings. It has often been
noticed how far better the work of redeeming the
interior of our churches from that state of dirt and
neglect that had degraded some at least below the
level of the very barns upon the glebe, has been
carried out where money has come in slowly, and at
intervals, rather than where some munificent patron
has readily found the funds to enter upon a big
contract.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">Religious Houses.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If the parish includes within its boundaries the
remains or the site of any abbey, priory, hospital,
monastic cell, or other religious building otherwise
than the parish church, the history and description
of such places must of course be separately undertaken.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
And let not the local historian consider it is
needless for him to explore into a subject that has
probably been treated of with greater or less detail
in the original edition of Dugdale’s “<i>Monasticon</i>,”
or with more precision in the expanded English
edition. The English abbeys or priories, whose
history can be said to have been exhaustively written,
could certainly be counted on the fingers of both
hands.</p>

<p>Should any one desire to thoroughly search into
the history of a religious house, it will be best in the
first place to ascertain whether there is any chartulary
or chartularies extant (to printed lists of which
we have previously referred) for Dugdale and subsequent
writers have often only quoted some two or
three out of a hundred charters, or ignored them
altogether. Secondly, the numerous references to
national records, all now to be found at the P. R. O.,
which are given in Tanner’s “Notitia,” or in the big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Dugdale, should be referred to seriatim. Thirdly,
the indexes and calendars to the various Rolls, etc.,
at the P. R. O., which have been mentioned under
the manorial history, should be looked through for
those more or less frequent references that are
almost certain to have been omitted by Tanner.
Fourthly, the Augmentation Books, and other likely
documents of the time of the Suppression of the
Monasteries, should be overhauled. Fifthly, special
MSS. dealing with the order to which the house
pertains, should be sought after; <i>e.g.</i>, if of the
Premonstratensian order, a store of unpublished
matter is almost certain to be found in the Peck
MSS. of the B. M., and in the Visitation Book of the
B., numbered Ashmole MSS. 1519. Sixthly, search
should also be made through the indexes of the
various Blue Book Reports of the Historical Manuscript
Commission, and inquiries set on foot as to
local private libraries. Seventhly, and though last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
this suggestion will often be found to be of great
value, questions should be asked through the pages
of that invaluable medium between literary men—<i>Notes
and Queries</i>.</p>

<p>It may also be found of use to study the precise
statutes and regulations of the particular order.
They will be found in full in the bulky folios
of Holstein’s “<i>Codex Regularum Monasticarum et
Canonicarum</i>,” 1759. Dugdale only gives an
abstract of the majority of them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i067.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="antiqua">General Topics.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Under this head we may classify the more general
and modern subjects that should not be left out of
any complete parochial history, but which it is
sufficient just to indicate without further comment,
only premising that the annalist should keep constantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
before him that it is the history of a parish,
and not of a county or country, on which he is
engaged, and that the more sparing he is of general
disquisitions the more likely he is to please his readers.</p>

<p>The value of a thorough study of the field-names,
of which we spoke in the first section of this manual,
will now also become apparent. Some names will
tell of a change of physical features, of swamps and
islands, where all is now dry and far removed from
water, or of forests and underwood, where the blade
of corn is now the highest vegetation; whilst others
will point to the previous existence of the vast common
fields, and their peculiar cultivation (concerning
which Maine’s “Village Communities” should be
read). Some will indicate the foolish ways in which
special crops were attempted to be forced by law
upon the people, for it is few parishes that have
not a “Flax Piece” as a witness to the futile legislation
of 24 Henry VIII.; whilst others tell of trades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
now extinct, or metals long since worked out. Some
speak of those early days when the wolf or the bear
roamed the woods and fields, the beaver dammed up
the streams, or the eagle swooped down upon its
prey; whilst others tell of the weapons whereby
these fauna were rendered extinct, for scarcely a
township can be found where some field is not termed
“the Butts,” names that certainly date back as far
as Edward IV., when it was enacted that every
Englishman should have a bow of his own height,
and that butts for the practice of archery should be
erected near every village, where the inhabitants
were obliged to shoot up and down on every feast day
under penalty of being mulcted a halfpenny.</p>

<p>It will, of course, be a matter of taste whether the
topics here enumerated should precede or follow the
manorial and ecclesiastical history.</p>

<p>I. Situation—extent—hill and river—caverns and
springs—scenic character—climate and temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>II. Geology—mineral workings—quarries.</p>

<p>III. Special vegetable productions, past and
present.</p>

<p>IV. Special Fauna—mammalia—birds—fish—reptiles—insects.</p>

<p>V. Agriculture, past and present. Inclosures of
different dates—Inclosure Acts; for the mostly sad
effects of these most selfish Acts, which profited the
rich at the expense of the poor, for lists of inclosures
from time of Queen Anne, and for other valuable
information on this topic, see “General Report on
Enclosures,” drawn up by the Board of Agriculture
in 1808. The Board of Agriculture, in the first
quarter of this century, drew up most valuable Surveys
of Agriculture for the different counties, many
of which are replete with varied and interesting
information. On the economic and antiquarian side
of this question, read Professor Rogers’s “History
of Agriculture and Prices in England.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>VI. Trades and manufactures, past and present.</p>

<p>VII. Fairs and markets.</p>

<p>VIII. Roads, canals, railways, and bridges—past
and present. Care should be taken in tracing out
disused roads, bridle paths, or pack-horse tracks.</p>

<p>IX. Folk-lore. Under this head will come customs
and ceremonies relating to childbearing,
churching, christening, courtship, betrothal, marriage,
death, and burial—public-house signs and
their meaning—customs and superstitious pertaining
to wells and streams—used and disused sports and
games—obsolete punishments, such as ducking-stool
or stocks—omens—witchcraft—ghosts—charms—divinations—and
other quaint or original customs.
Several books have lately been published on this
subject, but they are mostly instances of book-making,
and none come up to or surpass Ellis’s
edition of “Brand’s Popular Antiquities.” A most
useful publication society has been recently started,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
termed “The Folk Lore Society,” which has already
begun collecting and publishing. The Hon. Sec. is
G. Lawrence Gomme, Esq., Castelnau, Barnes.</p>

<p>X. Dialect. On this subject see the invaluable
publications of the “English Dialect Society,” now
(1879) in the seventh year of its existence. The
hon. secretary is J. H. Nodal, Esq., The Grange,
Heaton Moor, Stockport. One of their publications,
price 6s. to non-subscribers, is “A List of Books
relating to some of the counties of England.” Halliwell’s
“Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words”
will be found very useful.</p>

<p>XI. Poor Law and general Rating, history and
statistics.</p>

<p>XII. Population, inhabited houses, and other
census details at different periods.</p>

<p class="ph1">BEMROSE &amp; SONS’</p>

<p class="ph3">PROCESS OF FAC-SIMILE PRINTING.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="drop-cap2">THE process, briefly described, is as follows. The
Instantaneous or Fac-Simile Printing Ink is
made in sticks, to be rubbed like Indian Ink, as well
as in a liquid state in Bottles, price One Shilling
each. The ink should be used on ordinary paper,
of a good quality, and for very elaborate Drawings,
Whatman’s drawing paper is recommended. The
paper must be kept free from finger touches and
grease; and while the drawing is in progress, it is
well to have a piece of loose paper under the hand,
which serves to keep the paper clean and to try the
pen on after each supply or dip of ink. The lead
pencil may be used and left on the paper, as the
strokes will not interfere with the printing; and the
<i>Ink</i> Drawing must on no account be smeared or
rubbed with India Rubber, &amp;c.</p>

<p>For Circulars, Fac-Similes of old MSS., and Commercial
purposes, the ordinary pen will do; but for
Drawings, a fine steel pen or crow-quill should be
used.</p>

<p>Drawing or writing executed with the ink should
be sent flat, or round a roller, to Messrs. Bemrose
&amp; Sons, who will then print from it any required
number of copies in exact fac-simile.</p>
